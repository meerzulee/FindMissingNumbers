# Find Missing Numbers

This program reads a file containing a list of consecutive integers and finds two missing numbers from the list. The program is written in Node.js and uses the `fs` and `readline` modules to read the file.

## Time Complexity

The algorithm in this program can be used to find two missing numbers in a list of consecutive integers using the XOR operation. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and requires O(1) additional space, making it a very efficient solution for large lists of integers.

## Usage

To use the program, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program files are located. Then, run the program using the following command:

```
node find-missing-numbers.js <file_path>
```

## Acknowledgments

This program is based on the algorithm described in this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20026969/6123965).
